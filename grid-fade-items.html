        The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is working
        together with the industry to pioneer new cryptography standards that
        will protect data from both quantum and classical threats. In 2022, NIST
        selected four quantum-safe algorithms for standardization:
        CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON and SPHINCS+â€”more will
        follow. Initially developed by ST, Keccak algorithm plays a key role in
        most future quantum-safe algorithms.

        <b>Build new application standards</b><br />
        ST is actively contributing to new application standards that will
        support a mix of quantum-safe and classical algorithms.

        <b>Offer crypto-agile products</b><br />
        To keep up with evolving threats and cryptographic standards, ST R&D
        teams focus on the development of crypto-agile hardware and software
        products. The goal is to help developers quickly upgrade their
        solutions.
